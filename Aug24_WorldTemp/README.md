# AUG24_world_temperature

This project focuses on exploring the correlation between CO2 emission and temperature change in the world.
### Project Organization: Data Scientest
### Project Name: World Temperature Anomalies Analsysis


## Objective
The main goal of this project was to build a predictive model for surface temperature anomalies using a
dataset that incorporates variables like GDP, CO2 emissions, population, and other relevant factors.
The project involved identifying and proactively processing data structures to ensure data quality, visualizing
the data to identify trends and relationships, and using machine learning methods to model the relationship
between CO2 emissions and abnormal temperatures.
